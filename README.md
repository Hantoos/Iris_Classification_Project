# Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project serves as an introductory machine learning experiment. The goal is to build a classification model to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1.  **Dataset:** The widely-used, built-in Iris dataset from the scikit-learn library was utilized.
2.  **Algorithm:** The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness with this dataset.
3.  **Data Split:** The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

## ✅ Results
* **Model Accuracy:** The KNN model achieved an accuracy of **100%** on the unseen test data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
* Python
* Scikit-learn (for model and data)
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* Jupyter Notebook
